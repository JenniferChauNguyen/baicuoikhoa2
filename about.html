                <p>The hotel entrance set the tone of what we would soon come across, despite the building being fairly
                    old. The bedroom was huge and decorated in a sober-like type of approoach. The staff was very kind,
                    welcoming and always available to help us out. The hotel restaurant was fairly reasonable and the
                    servants particularly helpful.</p>
